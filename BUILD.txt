Currently I'm only building with Visual Studio, but there's no reason 
GetHooks can't be built using mingw. I prefer Visual Studio for 
debugging. gdb is not as reliable or powerful in windows. I don't have a 
makefile nor have I tested a mingw build yet. If you make one send it to 
me. 

I use Visual Studio 2010 Professional and I use two configurations 
frequently. The first configuration is the debug configuration. This is 
the standard boilerplate debug configuration. The second configuration 
is the MSVCRT configuration. I wanted GetHooks to work without any 
external dependencies and so I set this configuration to link to MSVCRT 
which is present on Win2k and above. This way I have a universal binary 
for Windows 2k/XP/Vista/7/8 that does not need Visual Studio 
dependencies; all that's needed to run is GetHooks.exe and no DLL files. 
However to compile using this config you'll need WinDDK. I used Windows 
Driver Kit version 7.1.0. 

Currently GetHooks when compiled using the MSVCRT configuration has 
passed testing on Windows XP/Vista/7/8. Although I designed GetHooks for 
Win2k as well it failed for reasons I don't yet know. I probably got an 
offset wrong in the handle table. I'd have to set up remote debugging in 
Win2k which is proving to be a real chore with VS2010 (it might be 
impossible).
